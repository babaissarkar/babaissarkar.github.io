	<h1>babaissarkar's Github Page</h1>
	<p>Hello, this is main page for all of my projects!</p>
	<p> I current have 4 repositories in Github, <b>paladin</b>, a CCG/TCG player, <b>myfnts</b>, a repository for my fonts Exodia, FProject and any new ones I may be designing in the future. FProject is also available from <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/fproject">Open Font Library</a>. <b>math2pic</b> is a collection of some small scripts I have written to use LaTeX equations in Markdown documents. Finally <b>prosder</b> is a simple command driven graphics language. This is all for now, but let's look forward to something great!</p>
	<p>Many thanks for visiting.:)</p>
