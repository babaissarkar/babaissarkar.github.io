            <li>Some time ago I've also decided to create <a href="https://github.com/babaissarkar/MyOpenLab">my own fork of the MyOpenLab project</a> to make it compatible with recent versions of the JavaÂ® runtime. It also has a AppImage build of MyOpenLab with limited functionality. MyOpenLab is a visual block like programming environment, originally available from <a href="https://www.myopenlab.org">here</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		This is all for now, but let's look forward to something great!</p>
	<p>Great news! My book is now available for buying at <a src="https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CW1BP5TL">Amazon</a>!. Buy this would be a great idea to support my work.</p>
